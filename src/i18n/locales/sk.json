        "answer": "All downloadable files are provided for viewing purposes only. Ownership rights for Instagram stories, photos, and videos remain with their original creators. We strongly discourage using or altering these files for any reason. Nevertheless, you may gather ideas, inspiration, or insights by reviewing and examining these materials, which could help you develop a content strategy for your future social media posts."

      {
        "question": "How can I view a saved story?",

Alternatively, open a new browser tab and drag the photo or video file into the tab, and the browser will automatically display it in the correct format. Please note that our service includes built-in functionality enabling anonymous viewing of Instagram stories directly through the interface by selecting the relevant interface options."
